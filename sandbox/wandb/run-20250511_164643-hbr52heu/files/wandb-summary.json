This can occur when the model is too complex or when the training data is not representative of the real-world data.\n\n**Key characteristics of overfitting:**\n\n* **High training accuracy:** The model achieves high accuracy on the training data, indicating that it can perfectly reproduce the training patterns.\n* **Low generalization accuracy:** When","_timestamp":1.7469748617791705e+09}
