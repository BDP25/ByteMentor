{"prompt":"What is the concept of overfitting in machine learning?","output":"What is the concept of overfitting in machine learning?\n\nOverfitting is when a machine learning model becomes too closely fit to the training data, rather than generalizing well to new data. This can lead to poor performance on unseen data, as the model has not learned the underlying patterns in the data.\n\n**Key concepts:**\n\n* **Statistical inference:** Machine learning models are trained to make predictions or decisions based on data.\n* **Generalization:** The goal of machine learning is to build models that can perform well on unseen data.\n*","_timestamp":1.7469749176265397e+09,"_runtime":54.9237947,"_step":3,"_wandb":{"runtime":54}}
